# Aizatron
4 Jul – 15 Jul 2022
I designed and implemented a basic Smart Attendance Register System using Python. I used MongoDB to store data; xlsxwriter (a python package) to create an Excel spreadsheet; and SMTP to email the Excel spreadsheet.

# Actiotech
15 Feb – 12 Mar 2021
I learned Go, a programming language used by the firm. This introduced me to the concept of concurrency.
