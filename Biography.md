I have a mind for analytic reasoning, which is one of the key attributes of an
engineer. This is useful is in programming. Using a programming language's
constructs, I can create functional applications.
I enjoy it because it feels like solving a puzzle: creating a cohesive and
functional unit from basic blocks. This applies in Maths as well: using
algebra principles to solve for an unknown in an equation.

High school and university mainly shaped my engineering identity.
In high school, choosing IT (Information Technology) in grade 10 was pivotal
to where my academic path would go. It introduced me to the world of
programming, and I was in love.

I decided to go into ECE (Electrical & Computer Engineering) because I
enjoyed programming and was good at Maths and Physics in school.
However, it was only in university that I fell in love with Maths and Physics.
I found the unexpected connections from different parts of Maths and
Physics incredibly fascinating. For instance, the uncertainty principle is
found in both Quantum Mechanics and Signals & Systems.
